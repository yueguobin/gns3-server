"""
In-memory snapshot of the RBAC state.

The controller keeps its whole runtime state (projects, computes,
notifications) in process memory: a second controller instance is not a
supported setup. This module applies the same idea to the RBAC tables.
All roles, ACEs, group memberships and resource pool memberships are
loaded once into a process-wide snapshot, permission checks then run
against the snapshot instead of querying the database on every request.

The database stays the source of truth. Every repository method that
writes an RBAC table marks the snapshot as dirty, and the next read
rebuilds it from the database. Rebuilding is a handful of small SELECTs
and only happens after (human frequency) administrative writes, so the
checks keep their exact semantics while dropping from several queries
per request (including a full resource scan) to an in-memory lookup.

The evaluation methods replicate the semantics of the previous
database-backed implementation, quirks included (path reverse traversal,
deny raising PermissionError, pool checks with the "/pool" prefix, group
ACEs in natural order while user ACEs are sorted by descending path).
One semantic is stronger here: a user-level ACE covering a path decides
the check alone, whatever role it carries, so a group grant can never
widen a reduced user-level role (this is what freezes a distributed
project copy for its recipient).
