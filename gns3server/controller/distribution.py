"""
In-memory registry of project distributions.

A distribution creates one project copy per recipient in the background
(a whole class can mean minutes of file copies). The job state lives in
this process-wide registry, like the rest of the controller state: the
client polls the job to follow the progress and read the per-recipient
results. Every state change is also written through to the
distribution_records table (see the API routes), so the history survives a
controller restart; this registry only holds the live jobs and frees the
finished ones after the retention period.
